# React Course Project by Regis Boamah

I'm excited to announce the launch of my upcoming course on **React**, and I'm thrilled to introduce you to the project you'll be building throughout the course!

   Get a guided tour of the typical React project structure, helping you understand where to organize your components, assets, and more.

3. **Introduction to JSX**  
   Understand the basics of **JSX**—a syntax extension that allows you to write HTML directly in your JavaScript—and how it fits into React.

4. **Introduction to TypeScript**
